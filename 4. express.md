### creating server with express

```js
const express = require("express");

// express in executable form
const app = express();

// routing done for the 'root' location
app.get("", (request, response) => {
  response.send("Home page");
});

// routing done for the 'about' location
app.get("/about", (request, response) => {
  response.send("about page");
});

// routing done for the 'help' location
app.get("/help", (request, response) => {
  response.send("help page");
});

// we will have to make server to make things execute on.
app.listen(3000);

```
```js
response <---------> request
(server)             (client)

```

### server always responds

- server was what, we are just creating.
- **RESPONSE** means our response to that thing,
- means what we will reply to the request we just received,
- means just sending data.

### clients always requests


### passing html via express

```js
const express = require("express");

// express in executable form
const app = express();

// routing done for the 'root' location
app.get("", (request, response) => {
  response.send(`

  <h1>Home page</h1>
  <a href = "/about"><h1>About</h1> </a>
  <a href = "/help"> <h1>Help</h1> </a>
    `);
});

// routing done for the 'about' location
app.get("/about", (request, response) => {
  response.send(`
  <input type="text" placeholder="Your name is"/>
  <button> Submit </button>

    `);
});

// routing done for the 'help' location
app.get("/help", (request, response) => {
  response.send("help page");
});

// we will have to make server to make things execute on.
app.listen(3000);

/*
 * how to get the data provided by the user.
 * what if he filled something in the name section, how to get that?
 * ans: request.query.name (or that property name)
 */

```


### Sending html files instead of content, 404 page

```js
/*
 * let say we have 3 pages in public folder in root.
 * about.html, help.html and index.html
 */

const express = require("express");

const app = express();

app.get("", (request, response) => {
  response.sendFile(`${__dirname}/public/index.html`);
});

app.get("/about", (request, response) => {
  response.sendFile(`${__dirname}/public/about.html`);
});

app.get("/help", (request, response) => {
  response.sendFile(`${__dirname}/public/help.html`);
});

/* if neither of above route match, it will go in the * area */
app.get("*", (request, response) => {
  response.send(`
    <h1> 404 not found </h1>
    `);
});

app.listen(3000);

```
